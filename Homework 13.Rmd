## Please estimate the model parameters of two different growth functions (VBGF; Gompertz) using the method maximum likelihood for the length-at-age for female Atlantic Croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), considering a multiplicative error model with log-normal distribution;

Calculate the 95% confidence intervals for each parameter of the growth functions by using the likelihood profile method

Conduct the model selection based on the AICc and quantify the plausibility of each model by using ¡§Akaike weight (wi)¡¨;

Estimate the average model based on wi and plot all the growth curves together!
