# Assignments for Computer Intensive Statistics in Ecology
My R codes for assignments in the course "Computer Intensive Statistics in Ecology". 

Each file contains codes that implement one or more computationally intensive methods using R. 

Methods include: 
* Bootstrap
* Jackknife, Permutation test, function optimization, k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), decision tree (CART), random forest, multinomial logistics regression, support vector machine, principal component analysis (PCA), multidimensional scaling (MDS), model selection criterion, Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (MCMC), and Neural network
