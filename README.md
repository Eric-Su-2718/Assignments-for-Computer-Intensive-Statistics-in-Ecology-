# Assignments for Computer Intensive Statistics in Ecology
My R codes for assignments in the course "Computer Intensive Statistics in Ecology". 

Each file contains codes that implement one or more computationally intensive methods using R. 

Methods include: 
* Bootstrap
* Jackknife
* Permutation test
* Function optimization
* K-means clustering
* Hierarchical clustering
* Linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
* Decision tree (CART) and random forest
* Multinomial logistics regression
* Support vector machine
* Principal component analysis (PCA)
* Multidimensional scaling (MDS)
* Model selection criterion (AIC, BIC)
* Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (MCMC)
* Neural network
